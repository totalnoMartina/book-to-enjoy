Welcome Martina Grganic,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **September 1, 2021**

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

## Release History

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**September 20 2023:** Update Python version to 3.9.17.

**September 1 2021:** Remove `PGHOSTADDR` environment variable.

**July 19 2021:** Remove `font_fix` script now that the terminal font issue is fixed.

**July 2 2021:** Remove extensions that are not available in Open VSX.

**June 30 2021:** Combined the P4 and P5 templates into one file, added the uptime script. See the FAQ at the end of this file.

**June 10 2021:** Added: `font_fix` script and alias to fix the Terminal font issue

**May 10 2021:** Added `heroku_config` script to allow Heroku API key to be stored as an environment variable.

**April 7 2021:** Upgraded the template for VS Code instead of Theia.

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

## FAQ about the uptime script

**Why have you added this script?**

It will help us to calculate how many running workspaces there are at any one time, which greatly helps us with cost and capacity planning. It will help us decide on the future direction of our cloud-based IDE strategy.

**How will this affect me?**

For everyday usage of Gitpod, it doesn’t have any effect at all. The script only captures the following data:

- An ID that is randomly generated each time the workspace is started.
- The current date and time
- The workspace status of “started” or “running”, which is sent every 5 minutes.

It is not possible for us or anyone else to trace the random ID back to an individual, and no personal data is being captured. It will not slow down the workspace or affect your work.

**So….?**

We want to tell you this so that we are being completely transparent about the data we collect and what we do with it.

**Can I opt out?**

Yes, you can. Since no personally identifiable information is being captured, we'd appreciate it if you let the script run; however if you are unhappy with the idea, simply run the following commands from the terminal window after creating the workspace, and this will remove the uptime script:

```
pkill uptime.sh
rm .vscode/uptime.sh
```

**Anything more?**

Yes! We'd strongly encourage you to look at the source code of the `uptime.sh` file so that you know what it's doing. As future software developers, it will be great practice to see how these shell scripts work.

Happy coding!

## User Stories

The user stories were categorized into different priorities, from highest to lowest: "Should Have" ,"Must Have", "Could Have", "Wont Have". User Stories that have been labeled as "Wont Have" are not prioritized to be implemented in this edition of this app but as a future feature.

The User Stories that have been satisfied are:

|User Story |Image of the User Story completed|Label|
|-----------------------|---------------------------------|-----------
|[#1](https://github.com/totalnoMartina/irish-macrame/issues/1) Add Subscription to newsletter| ![Add Newsletter supscription](/media/newsletter.png?raw=true)|Must Have||

# Agile Methodology
[Project Agile](/media/user-stories-image-kanban.png?raw=true)

To create the User stories I used Github Issues and then I grouped them according to MoSCoW prioritization technique. The link with live issues can be found [here](https://github.com/users/totalnoMartina/projects/6). Some of the User Stories will be left for the future development and they are labeled as 'Could Have'.

maybe separate file or manual testing
# Deployment and making a clone
## Deployment to heroku

**In your app** 

1. Add the list of requirements by writing in the terminal "pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt"
2. Git add and git commit the changes made

**Log into heroku**

3. Log into [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) or create a new account and log in

4. top right-hand corner click "New" and choose the option Create new app, if you are a new user, the "Create new app" button will appear in the middle of the screen

11. Add the below variables to the list

    * Database URL will be added automaticaly
    * Secret_key - one can be generated [here](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/) or make up your own secret key.


**Go back to your code**

12. Procfile needs to be created in your app
Content of Procfile has a structure like this :
```
web: gunicorn PROJECT_NAME.wsgi
```

13. In settings in your app add your name of your Heroku App to ALLOWED_HOSTS without the starting slashes and 'https:'

14. Add and commit the changes in your code and push to github

**Final step - deployment**

15. Next go to "Deploy" in the menu bar on the top 

16. Go to section "deployment method", choose "GitHub"

17. New section will appear "Connect to GitHub" - Search for the repository to connect to

18. type the name of your repository and click "search"

19. once Heroku finds your repository - click "connect"

20. Scroll down to the section "Automatic Deploys"

21. Click "Enable automatic deploys" or choose "Deploy branch" and manually deploy

22. Click "Deploy branch"

Once the program runs:
you should see the message "the app was sussesfully deployed"

23. Click the button "View"

## Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository you will be able to make a copy of the original repository on your own GitHub account allowing you to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/totalnoMartina/irish-macrame)
2. In the same line as the name of your repository, on the right side there are a few buttons, locate the "Fork" button and click on it
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

## Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/totalnoMartina/irish-macrame)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open commandline interface on your computer
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/totalnoMartina/irish-macrame
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

## Setting up your local enviroment

1. Create Virtual enviroment on your computer or use gitpod built-in virtual enviroment feature.

2. Create env.py file. It needs to contain those 5 variables.

* Database URL can be obtained from [heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/), add PostgreSQL as an add-on when creating an app. 
* Secret_key - the django secret key can be generated [here](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/). 
* Cloudinary URL can be obtained from [cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) follow the steps on the website to register. 
* Google API key can be obtained [here](https://cloud.google.com/gcp?authuser=1) you will have to register with google and create new app to get the API key. Follow the instructions on the website.

```
DEVELOPMENT
SECRET_KEY

STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY 
STRIPE_WH_SECRET

```
PostgreSQL and Cloudinary URL keys are needed only on Heroku, not in local IDE

3. Run command 
```
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```

## Getting Stripe keys
Go to developers tab. On side menu you will find API keys. Copy STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY and STRIPE_SECRET_KEY.

(The next part I did not implement but it might be useful for the fellow developers)
Go to Webhooks. Click Add Endpoint button in top right hand corner.
Add endpoint URL (your local or deployed URL)
Add all events 
Than click add endpoint
You should be redirected to this webhook's page. Reveal webhook sign in secret and copy to Settings and to heroku as STRIPE_WH_SECRET variable
(I skipped this part until here, and made an app on google)

## Getting email variables from gmail

- Log into gmail account
- Go to Settings and than See all settings
- Top menu go to Accounts and import
- Find on the list Other google account settings
- Left side menu - Security
- Turn on two step verification: add phone number and follow instructions
- Go back to security
App passwords - Select Mail, Select Device - Other, Django, Copy app password.

In Heroku 
EMAIL_HOST_PASS is the password copied from above.
EMAIL_HOST_USER is the gmail email address
